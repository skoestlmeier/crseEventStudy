`crseEventStudy` is an R package providing a standardized test for abnormal returns in long-horizon event studies that takes into accoutncross-sectional correltaion, autocorrelation, and heteroskedasticity of stock returns. The test is proposed in the paper *[A robust and powerful test of abnormal stock returns in long-horizon event studies](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jempfin.2018.02.004)* by Anupam Dutta, Johan Knif, James W. Kolari and Seppo Pynnonen.

### Key Features
Functions for crseEventStudy for testing abnormal stock returns in long-horizon event studies:

* crseEvent

Installation
------------
```r
# The easiest way to install crseEventStudy is to download via CRAN
install.packages("crseEventStudy")

# Alternatively, you can install the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("skoestlmeier/crseEventStudy")
```
Notes
-----
The method `crseEvent` is based on abnormal standardized returns and offers two implementations. Standardized returns are defined as \eqn{sr_{it} = \frac{r_{it}}{s_{it}}} where \eqn{s_{it}} is a standard deviation estimator of log returns \eqn{r_{it}}:

\strong{Use of Abnormal standardized returns (ASR)}

Abnormal standardized returns are defined as \eqn{ASR_{it} = sr_{it} - sr_{ci,t}}, where \eqn{sr_{ci,t}} is the standardized return of the matching control firm or the average of standardized returns of the matching control portfolio.

\strong{Use of Continuously compounded abnormal returns (CCAR)}

Continuously compounded abnormal returns are defined as \eqn{CCAR{it} = r_{it} - r_{ci,t}}, where \eqn{r_{it} = log(1 + R_{it}} is the event month \eqn{t} continuously compounded return (i.e., log return) of event stock \eqn{i}, and \eqn{r_{ci,t}} is the continuously compounded return of the control firm.
